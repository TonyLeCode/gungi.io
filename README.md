## Why did you make this?
This game appears in the manga/anime Hunter × Hunter, and seemed really interesting and looked like it had a ton of complexity and depth to play around in. 

So, inspired by this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HunterXHunter/comments/6803yz/revised_rules_of_gungi_in_hunterxhunter_pdf/) which spelled out a complete ruleset, I set out to make it a reality and accessible for anyone to play and explore. 

An additional side benefit in making this was to use it as a learning opporutnity to familiarize myself with some of the latest popular web technologies, and this is the first project of more to come!
